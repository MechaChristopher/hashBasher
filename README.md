# hashBasher
My uploaded program for the Blockchain &amp; Applications Homework 2 assignment

The .java file to be executed has the following file path: hashBasher\HashFunctions2\src\hashBasher.java
Once open, the program will prompt the user for a SHA-1 hash 
After entering the hash, an included password list will be searched for a hash value matching the one provided.

Output includes a matching password if one was found and the number of attempts before the match was located.
Before running the program again, it will have to be closed and relaunched.
